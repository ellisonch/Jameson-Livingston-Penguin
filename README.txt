Hey, thanks for checking out my LD21 entry, Jameson Livingston Penguin. It ain't perfect, but this was my first LD
ever so my only real goal was to finish. Everything beyond that was just icing. I hope you enjoy, and if you don't,
I will hunt you down. I'm sure there are some bugs, inconsistencies, whathaveyous, but that's what you get for 2 days of work.

You may use the source code for anything you like, but I'd appreciate if you let me know when you're using it. As for
the art assets, I'd appreciate if you didn't rip em. But if you want something, do let me know.
